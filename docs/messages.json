Looks like the app crash during the processing was due to a high token count of 4k (Which caused memory overflow).\n\n     Now I've reduced the token to 2k; the local processing runs smoothly, (had to disabled the tags/links in gemma output due to that). You can expect a release tomorrow, with Gemma included in the stable build (along with several other exciting new features). You can run it in the background and it will finish on its own. Just wanted to give you the update. Thank you so much for trying the app. See ya tomorrow!\n\nWith love,\nTeam Fetchify",

Gemma now allows full on-device processing - your images never go to the cloud.\n\nThis is an early alpha release, so expect some bugs: batch processing may not always work, and the app might crash or even affect background apps. You can still try the single-image processing reliably by tapping the AI icon on the screenshot details page.\n\nI've shared a Google Form for your feedback [click on LEARN MORE button] (and again after a week). Please report any issues so we can polish everything before public launch.\n\nThank you for being a part of this journey 🙌\n\n- With love,\nTeam Fetchify",
